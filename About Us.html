<p>SteemSwift is a website built using Html, CSS and JavaScipt and which focuses on curating posts from users of Steemit or any
of its sister apps that are of great quality, informative, with beautiful pictures, and are free from any forms of plagiarism.
    <br>
    <br>
As such, once you make a post via any of these;</p>
        
<ul>
    <li>Steemit</li>
    <li>Busy.org</li>
    <li>Utopian.io</li>
    <li>Esteem app</li>
    <li>Steepshot</li>
    <li>DLive</li>
    <li>DTube, e.t.c,</li>
    
    </ul>




your post automatically becomes qualified to be chosen to appear on the SteemSwift website. 

<br>
<br>

Selecting these quality posts is majorly achieved by manually going through posts on Steemit and choosing only originally written
articles.

<br>
<br>

In order to ensure that these articles have been originally written, they are run through plagiarism tools so as to detect those
that were plagiarized.
        
        <br>
        <br>
Once your post has passed this rigorous examination, it then becomes eligible to appear on the SteemSwift website.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
It also becomes eligible for an upvote, as well as a resteem from the owners and moderators of this website.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
Luckily, steemswift is free to use and does not require any payments from you once your post appears on the website.
